# Repository of code and data created during my internship at the IHA/DHI Paris.
## Introduction
This repository is a collection of all scripts used for processing and visualising the data from the
Constance de Salm correspondence. It also includes the original data (CSV file) that was used plus almost 
all visualisations as demonstrative PNG or GIFs.

## Histograms
Some visualisations that are included are histograms of correspondences throughout the decades. In lieu
of visualising them in Python, further steps were taken in Excel for better team-intern accessibility, readability
and reusability. The script mainly provides tools for filtering the data basis for Excel.

## Network
The network is interactive and based on HTML using Plotly and Dash.
